# Contributing to Diabetes Risk Prediction Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this machine learning project!

## Project Goals

This project aims to explore various confidence estimation techniques for diabetes classification under both binary and multiclass scenarios. It's designed as a final project for a machine learning course.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check if the issue already exists in the Issues tab
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem/suggestion
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add docstrings to functions
   - Include comments for complex logic
   - Test your changes in Jupyter notebooks

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Describe what changes you made and why
   - Link any related issues

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on a single task
- Add comments for complex algorithms

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Clear markdown headers for each section
- Include explanatory text between code cells
- Visualize results when appropriate
- Clean output before committing (optional for this project)

### Testing

- Test your code in a clean environment
- Verify notebooks run from top to bottom without errors
- Check that visualizations display correctly

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Document any new dependencies in requirements.txt
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
